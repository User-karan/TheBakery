    <p>
      Welcome to I Doughnut Care, where indulgence meets comfort, and every dessert tells a story. Born out of a love for baking and a passion for spreading smiles, our little bakery started with one mission: to make every bite count.

Founded in the heart of Pokhara, we began as a cozy home kitchen experiment that quickly grew into a local favorite. What started with a few stuffed donuts shared among friends has now become a full-blown dessert destination loved by sweet tooths of all ages.

At I Doughnut Care, we specialize in handcrafted treats made fresh daily using only the finest ingredients. From fluffy donuts filled with creamy surprises to luscious cakes, croissants, and whimsical cupcakes, we believe dessert should never be boring and neither should your experience.
But we’re not just about sweets. We’re about moments, the joy of sharing a box of donuts,cupcakes with your friends, celebrating milestones with a slice of our signature cakes, or simply treating yourself after a long day.

Whether you're a loyal regular or a first-time visitor, we welcome you to our dessert family with open arms.
Thank you for choosing us. We doughnut take you for granted.
